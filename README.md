# 🌐 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my **personal portfolio website** – a project that starts small but aims big. This is where I will showcase my journey, work, and growth as a developer.

---

## 🚀 Vision

This project is more than just a static page. My long-term goal is to build a **fully functional platform** that includes:

- 🎨 A beautifully crafted **portfolio** to display my projects and skills.
- 📄 A **Resume** for potential collaborators, clients, or employers.
- ✍️ A **Blog** – the heart of this site – where I will share my thoughts, ideas, lessons, and experiences. It will serve as both a creative outlet and a technical journal.
- 📊 A **personal dashboard** to update my records, track goals, and manage content.
- 🔧 A **.NET backend** to power dynamic features and provide scalability for future enhancements.

## ✅ Current Status

Right now, this is a **basic page** – a minimal start that sets the foundation for future development. Every day, I will aim to improve it, refine the design, and add new features.
